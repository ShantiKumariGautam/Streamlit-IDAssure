# IDAssure â€“ Smart Identity Verification App

**IDAssure** is an AI-powered identity verification web application built with **Streamlit**.  
It uses **face matching** and **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** to verify identity from an Aadhar card (image or PDF) and a live selfie. It also extracts the date of birth and estimates age to support eligibility checks.
